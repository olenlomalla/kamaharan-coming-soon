            answer="For Umrah, you'll need a valid passport with at least six months validity, an Umrah visa (which we'll assist you with), appropriate Islamic attire including Ihram (we will provide). Most importantly, come with a mindset ready for spiritual growth, discipline, and meaningful brotherhood."

            question="How does the Kamaharan Development Programme Work?"
            answer="After returning to the UK, participants are offered priority access to open roles across Kamaharan's growing tech and AI projects. Whether it's contributing to real-world digital solutions, creative content, or community tech initiatives, each opportunity is designed to build skills, confidence, and purpose. These roles enable participants to gain valuable experience, earn an income, and continue their personal and professional development as part of Kamaharan's long-term mission."

            question="What's the typical group size?"
            answer="We limit our groups to 25 brothers to ensure a meaningful, personal experience. This creates an intimate environment for building connections while providing enough diversity for enriching networking opportunities."

          <FAQItem
            question="Is there a payment plan available?"

          />

          <FAQItem
            question="What if I already have a job?"
            answer="That's absolutely fine. Kamaharan's mission is to support your personal and professional development, no matter your current situation. Even if you're already working, there will always be opportunities to earn extra income on the side or during weekends through Kamaharan's projects. Whether it's gaining new skills, expanding your network, or exploring part-time roles in tech and AI, there's a place for you in the journey."
